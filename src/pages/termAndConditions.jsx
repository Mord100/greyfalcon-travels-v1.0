If we are unable to contact you, we will treat the order as cancelled. If you have already paid for your order and don't accept alternative price / option and would like to cancel, you will receive a full refund.

            <p className="text-slate-700 mb-4">
              <strong>2.3</strong> Please note Grey Falcon Travels LTD acts only as an agent between you and our suppliers (Travel Service Providers) and where a Travel Service Provider's services form part of your booking, the Travel Service Provider's standard terms and conditions will also apply in addition to these terms & conditions.
            </p>
            <p className="text-slate-700 mb-4">
              <strong>2.4</strong> Please check that all names, dates and booking details are correct upon receipt of your booking confirmation/s. Unless we have made an administrative error, cancellation charges and additional Booking Fees will apply to alterations to your booking/s. It is therefore important that all names and other details provided by you at the time of booking are accurate and agreed by all members of your party.

            <p className="text-slate-700 mb-4">
              In the event that we make a request on your behalf, for example relating to meals, room requests etc; we will communicate that request to the Travel Service Provider. A request cannot be guaranteed and therefore we cannot be held responsible if your request is not agreed by the Travel Service Provider.

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-slate-900 mb-4">4. Payments</h2>
            <p className="text-slate-700 mb-4">
              <strong>4.1</strong> All hotel bookings confirmed with Grey Falcon Travels are processed through either our Business bank account or through card payment with our merchant account. Hotel vouchers and invoices are issued by Grey Falcon Travels.
            </p>
            <p className="text-slate-700 mb-4">
              <strong>4.2</strong> With regards to bookings made within 5 days of hotel check in, card payments through our merchant will be accepted, where you will be sent a secure link with the agreed rate, that will allow you to process payment via debit/credit card. Such reservations will be treated as Non-refundable, and no refunds will be made if travel plans are to change.
            </p>
            <p className="text-slate-700 mb-4">
              <strong>4.3</strong> Hotel check ins that are beyond the 5 day period can only be settled with a bank transfer to our business bank account.
            </p>
            <p className="text-slate-700 mb-4">
              <strong>4.4</strong> We do not accept deposits to confirm your hotel booking and full payment is required at the time of booking. If you have any query regarding your payment please contact us on the contact number on the website or via email.
            </p>
            <p className="text-slate-700 mb-4">
              <strong>4.5</strong> It is your responsibility to ensure that payment in full is made for hotel reservations prior to receiving your hotel accommodation voucher. Grey Falcon Travels accepts no liability or responsibility for any costs or losses arising from cancellation, delay or itinerary amendment resulting from a failure to make payment in full as required by these terms and conditions of business or those of Travel Service Providers.
            </p>
            <p className="text-slate-700 mb-4">
              <strong>4.6</strong> Please note when you make payment at the time of your booking/s this does not mean that your booking/s is/are confirmed. We will provide confirmation of your booking/s once we have confirmed your booking with the Travel Service Provider/s. If you make payment and the Travel Service Provider is unable to confirm your booking to us, then you will of course receive a full refund. Please note that refunds in these circumstances will only apply to the unconfirmed booking and you will remain committed to any other bookings made at the same time and will be bound by the Travel Service Provider's cancellation policy. It is therefore important that you understand the terms and conditions of all Travel Service Providers before making payment to us upon booking.

              All documents relating to your booking will be sent to you by email or by post. We shall not be responsible for the loss of your documents unless such loss is caused by our negligence. If as a result of loss in the post, documents must be reissued, any additional fees or charges must be paid by you.

            <p className="text-slate-700 mb-4">
              <strong>6.1</strong> If you need to cancel a hotel booking you must contact us in writing. To cover the cost of administration and cancellation charges imposed by hotel suppliers and in consideration of the possibility that we will not be able to resell the hotel accommodation booking, we will apply a cancellation charge. This charge can be later claimed through your travel insurance, (if any).
            </p>
            <p className="text-slate-700 mb-4">
              <strong>6.2</strong> Please note some hotel bookings are non-refundable before/after travel dates; Cancellation charges vary depending on the hotel booked and will be clearly stated at the time of booking. A cancellation charge of £40.00 per passenger will be applied by us in addition to any cancellation charges levied in accordance with the Travel Service Providers terms and conditions of business regardless of the value of service cancelled.
            </p>
            <p className="text-slate-700 mb-4">
              <strong>6.3</strong> Our Cancellation Charges and Booking Fees will apply even if the Travel Service Provider's terms and conditions provide for a full refund upon cancellation.
            </p>
            <p className="text-slate-700 mb-4">
              <strong>6.4</strong> If you are unsure as to whether you will receive a full or partial refund upon cancellation we would recommend that you contact us before confirming your booking or, if you have already booked, prior to confirming your cancellation.

            <p className="text-slate-700 mb-4">
              If you wish to make a change to a confirmed booking please contact us in writing. A change to the hotel accommodation check in date once confirmed, is regarded as a cancellation and rebooking, not an alteration to the booking. Cancellation Charges will therefore apply and Booking Fees will be charged in respect of the rebooking. Our Cancellation Charges and Booking Fees will be additional to any administrative fee, cancellation fees and rebooking charges levied by the Travel Service Provider.

            <p className="text-slate-700 mb-4">
              <strong>8.1</strong> Although it is unlikely, we may have to make changes to your travel arrangements and we must reserve the right to do so. We will inform you of any major changes at the time of booking, or as soon as possible afterwards if you have already booked. If a major change is necessary, such as a change of resort/hotel, or reduction in standard of your accommodation, you will be offered the choice of: (a) Accepting the change; or (b) Accepting an alternative, or; (c) Receiving a full refund of all monies paid.
            </p>
            <p className="text-slate-700 mb-4">
              <strong>8.2</strong> If the alteration results in a reduction in the total cost of your travel arrangements, we will make an appropriate refund. Where we only act as a booking agent, particularly in the case of hotel accommodation, we may not be notified of a major change before you travel. However, where we are notified, we will advise you as soon as is reasonably possible. If the changes are not acceptable to you, we will offer you an alternative if available, or a refund. If your chosen alternative costs more, you must pay the difference.

            <p className="text-slate-700 mb-4">
              <strong>9.1</strong> If upon cancellation or alteration of your booking a refund is payable to you via Grey Falcon Travels in accordance with these terms and conditions and / or the Travel Service Provider's terms and conditions then we will release the refund payment to you as soon as the amount of the refund due to you is confirmed and remitted to us by the Travel Service Provider.
            </p>
            <p className="text-slate-700 mb-4">
              <strong>9.2</strong> We will do all that we can to ensure that your refund is processed quickly by the Travel Service Provider but we provide no warranty or guarantee as to how long a Travel Service Provider will take to process the refund. We accept no responsibility or liability for any costs or losses caused by any delay on the part of the Travel Service Provider in processing your refund. If delays on the part of the Travel Service Provider do arise we shall keep you informed and updated and will do our best to help resolve matters as quickly as possible.

            <p className="text-slate-700 mb-4">
              <strong>10.1</strong> Passengers must be in possession of a valid passport, necessary visas, plus any international health certificates required by the countries being visited. In the event that you are refused permission to board a flight or enter any country due to incorrect documentation, or health precautions, no liability can be accepted by Grey Falcon Travels Ltd and no refunds will be made unless sanctioned by the Travel Service Provider's terms and conditions of business.
            </p>
            <p className="text-slate-700 mb-4">
              <strong>10.2</strong> Please note that it is very unlikely that a Travel Service Provider will offer a full or a partial refund in circumstances where a passenger has failed to ensure that they have the correct documents required to travel. We would therefore advise that you check these requirements and the time it might take to satisfy them before you place your booking.

              <strong>11.1</strong> We will not refund the cost of unused hotel nights unless a full or partial refund in these circumstances is confirmed by the Travel Service Providers own terms and conditions of business.
            </p>
            <p className="text-slate-700 mb-4">
              <strong>11.2</strong> We would strongly advise you to consider purchasing a travel insurance policy which covers your travel, accommodation and related costs in the event of illness, personal emergency, accidents and delays not connected with the Travel Service Providers services.

              <strong>12.1</strong> The prices shown are correct at the time of booking. We reserve the right to increase the price after booking if any increase in price occurs in respect of: (i) Taxes or duties payable, including new taxes introduced by any government and; (ii) Adverse changes to currency exchange rates.
            </p>
            <p className="text-slate-700 mb-4">
              <strong>12.2</strong> In all cases we will pay any increase which is less than 2% of your hotel accommodation, not including insurance premiums or amendment fees but increases in excess of 2% will be payable by you. If the cost of your hotel accommodation increases by more than 10% you may decide to cancel the entire reservation and have a full refund. If you want to cancel you must tell us within 7 days of being advised of the price increase.
